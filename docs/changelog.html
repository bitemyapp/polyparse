<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.11</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for the Applicative/Monad/Functor classes rearrangement in
    ghc-7.10.*.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.10</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A new basic text-accepting combinator "literal", accepts the given
    string, without lexing it into Haskell-like words ("isWord").
<li>A more correct implementation of "manyFinally".
<li>A new combinator "satisfyMsg" which has a string describing the predicate,
    in order to produce more informative error messages.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.9</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Change Text.Parse.bracket to backtrack if the closing bracket is missing.
    If you rely on not backtracking, you can instead use "commit" in the
    closing bracket parser.
<li>The performance of multiple-commit squashing is improved.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.8</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Change ByteString parser API to return Word8 instead of Char.
<li>The previous ByteString parser API is now called ByteStringChar.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.7</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Modify imports for forward compatibility with ghc-7.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.6</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Expose a Data.Text variant of the parser combinators, based loosely
    on the ByteString variant.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.5</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A huge internal rearrangement of the Poly variations:
    (1) to share as much code as possible, avoiding cut-n-paste copies; and
    (2) to use the standard Control.Applicative interface.

<li>The Result type that was previously defined afresh for each variation
    (Plain,Lazy,State,ByteString, etc) is now defined in one place.

<li>The Parser type that was previously essentially identical between
    Plain/Lazy, apart from a very small number of class methods, has now
    been pulled out into a separate module.  This makes it clearer that
    almost everything is shared between Plain and Lazy, with the precise
    differences isolated to runParser and the instance of Applicative.
    (Likewise the Parser type shared between State/StateLazy.)

<li>The `apply` and `discard` methods previously were not the standard
    ones from Control.Applicative (&lt;*&gt; and &lt;*), but now they are.
    The old names have been retained as synonyms.

<li>The `onFail` method was previously not the standard &lt;|&gt; from class
    Alternative in Control.Applicative.  Now it is.  The old name has been
    retained too.

<li>The use of standard classes means that the former PolyParse class was in
    the wrong place in the dependency hierarchy.  Its remaining methods
    have been moved into a new class called Commitment, reflecting their
    purpose.  Class PolyParse itself now has no methods of its own, it merely
    gathers all of the other classes that are required (Functor, Monad,
    Applicative, Alternative, and Commitment).

<li>The exports of the modules Plain, Lazy, State, and StateLazy, remain
    essentially as before, so users should not need to make too many
    changes.  The main one is, if they defined their own parser monad, some
    of the methods must now be moved/defined in different classes.

<li>Some performance improvements to the Text.Parse.ByteString variant.

<li>A new Poly variant, Text.ParserCombinators.Poly.Lex, with a new
    iteratee-style tokenising input type.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.4.1</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for 'discard', so that in the lazy variation it actually checks
    that the item to be discarded satisfies the given parser.
<li>Bugfixes in Text.Parse, such that 'optionalParens' is used more
    consistently.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.4</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>New API: the primitive parser 'eof' is now available in all variations of
    the Poly combinators.
<li>New implementation of Text.Parse.word - it no longer uses the
    Haskell'98 Prelude.lex, but provides its own proper lexer, with better
    error messages.
<li>New module: Text.ParserCombinators.Poly.ByteString is an instance of
    the PolyParse class specialised to ByteString input, rather than being
    polymorphic over the input token type.
<li>New module: Text.Parse.ByteString, is like Text.Parse but with
    ByteString input rather than String.
<li>New API calls: Text.Parse.readByParse and readsPrecByParsePrec,
    to make it easy to create instances of the old Read class (for
    backwards compatibility) from your TextParser.
<li>Bugfix: in Text.Parse, parseInt, parseDec, parseOct, and parseHex had an
    extra spurious argument that was unused, so it has been removed (API
    change).  In addition parseLitChar relied on the non-existent use of
    that argument, so it has been fixed too.
<li>Bugfix: Text.Parse.parseFloat now accepts a plain integer as a float,
    to match the H'98 behaviour of readFloat.
<li>Bugfix: the `discard` combinator now forces the discarded item;
    previously incorrect parses could hide inside, without triggering an error.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.3</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix: Text.Parse.parseFloat now accepts ordinary floating point
    notation, in addition to scientific (exponent) notation.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.2</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Improves the Text.Parse implementation significantly.  Where
    previously all the parsers for builtin basic datatype (Int,Float,Char)
    were just thin wrappers over the H'98 Read instances, now they are all
    proper parsers, therefore they should (a) be faster; (b) give better
    error messages.
<li>Reduced the number of implementation variations to choose from.
    In particular, NoLeak has become the default implementation, and
    the previous default has been dropped (because it space-leaks).
<!--
<li>[desired] The class interface providing common operations across all
    implementations, now need be no slower than the previous
    cut-n-pasted interface, due to compiler specialisation of all the
    instances.
<li>[desired] New combinators for parsing infix structures, with
    associativity and precedence information.
<li>[desired] Multiple layers of bracketing can be parsed in linear time,
    rather than the previous exponential solution.
-->
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.1</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Much improved the laziness of the PolyLazy combinators.
<li>Addition of a class-based interface to the Poly libraries, to
    reduce code duplication amongst the variations, and to allow for
    more experimentation with different implementations.
<li>Several new experimental implementations of the interface.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.0</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Version number change from 1.00 to 1.0, for silly cabal/hackage.
<li>Minor fix to parsing strings in Text.Parse.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.00</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>No changes, but released separately from HaXml
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.16</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: lazier parsers
     <ul>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.Html.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyStateLazy</tt>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.15</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: DrIFT has now been fully updated to
     produce instances of Text.ParserCombinators.TextParser.Parse.
<li> New: the parser combinator library Poly has been split into two
     variations, Poly and PolyState.  They have almost the same API,
     only the latter includes a running state where the former does not.
<li> The TextParser library (a replacement for the Haskell'98 Read class)
     has also been improved with more new combinators.  Really, these
     parser combinator experiments do not belong in HaXml, and will
     eventually be split out into a separate package.
</ul>
